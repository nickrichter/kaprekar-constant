	<h2>What is this?</h2>
	
	<p>In short, Kaprekar's Constant is a fixed point in an iterative algorithm invented by Indian mathematician <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._R._Kaprekar" target="kapout">D.R. Kaprekar</a>. This algorithm is called, you guessed it, <strong>Kaprekar's Routine</strong>. The basic idea is that if you use any 4-digit number with at least two unique digits and run it through this algorithm, <em>you will reach the number 6174 in no more than seven steps</em>. 6174 is the endpoint of the process.</p>
	
	<p>There are different values besides 6174 in non base 10 systems, but that is well beyond the scope of this project. I am <em>not</em> a mathematician. I am just a dude who stumbled upon this funny little math thing.</p>
