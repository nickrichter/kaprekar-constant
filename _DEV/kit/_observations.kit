<h2>Observations</h2>

<p>I did notice a quirk about this algorithm that might be worth pointing out. If the input has only two unique numbers and those two numbers are sequential, it sort of breaks the process.</p>

<p>For example, if the input is 4544 the resulting calculation is <span class="numbers">5444 - 4445 = 999</span>. The result in cases such as these will <em>always</em> be 999. You can see why we are in a bit of a pickle at this point. The algorithm depends on an input with 4 digits.</p>

<p>To get around this we have to cheat a little bit and add a leading zero, passing along 0999 as our input. By doing this the resulting calculation will be <span class="numbers">9990 - 0999 = 8991</span>, which we can then use to continue the routine.</p>
