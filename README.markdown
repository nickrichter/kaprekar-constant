Kaprekar's Constant
===================

Kaprekar's Constant is a fixed point in an iterative algorithm developed by Indian mathematician [D.R. Kaprekar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D._R._Kaprekar). This repository is a simple webpage that explains and demonstrates how it works.

If you want to see it in action simply clone the repository, then open public_html/index.html in your browser.

The technical underpinnings are actually quite simple. The webpage itself describes the process. To see how I translated that into a functional bit of JavaScript, check out _DEV/js/main.js.
